# FTL stats overlay for twitch.

Requires python.

Alter parser.py to point to your continue.sav path.

Use the .html files as browser sources in OBS.

Sometimes you might get an error in FTL saying saving failed, the game will be fine. This happens when the script is accessing the save file at the same time as FTL is trying to save.
